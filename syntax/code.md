# The code blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used to write programming or to highlight source code. More than a simple pragma, the lines of code of a block of code are literally interpreted.

Here is an example :

```
This is a block of code 
```

In order to create a block of code in Markdown, it is sufficient to ident each line of the block with at least 4 spaces or a tabulation.

For exemple :

```
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a block of code.
```

You can also create a separate code block with:

    ```

### Online code block

The online code blocks can be written using: `

For example:

    This is an 'on-line code block'

### The syntax for highlighting 

You can define the language used to highlight the syntax by adding a name to an opening keyword. Example :

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
